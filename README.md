# CoronaVirus-A-model-for-When-you-should-close-your-office
This is a model to determine when an office should be closed based on the information available on the infected areas. It was first published by Tomas Pueyo on Medium.com (https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). However, he used spreadsheet file to implement the model (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/17YyCmjb2Z2QwMiRRwAb7W0vQoEAiL9Co0ARsl03dSlw/copy?usp=sharing), and this project intends to implement it using Streamlit framework (The app is available in both English &amp; Somali languages)
